#   Student Management System

####    A simple Python application using PyQt5 that allows you to manage student records. You can add, update, delete, and view student information such as name, age, grade, and DNI (ID number). The data is stored in a local JSON file.

##   Features
####    - Add a student with the following fields: Name, Age, Grade, DNI.
####    - Update student information.
####    - Delete student records.
####    - View a list of students.
####    - Status bar displays success or error messages.
####    - Data is stored and managed in a students.json file.

##   Prerequisites
####    Before you can run this application, make sure you have the following installed:
####    - Python 3.x
####    - PyQt5

## How it Works
#### 1.The application opens a window with input fields to add or update student information.
#### 2.The status bar at the bottom provides feedback after actions (e.g., "Student added successfully!").
#### 3.You can view the list of students.
#### 4.When you select a student from the list, their data will be displayed in the input fields, where you can update or delete them.

## Limitations
